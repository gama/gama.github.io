      <h2 class="visible-print-block">About</h2>
      <p>
      I am a software architect and lead engineer with more than 20
      years in the industry. I have a long history working on the design and
      implementation of complex systems and applications, ranging from applied
      research in machine learning, computer vision and fintec through
      mission-critical large scale enterprise software.
      </p>
      <p>
      At my current position at <a href="https://nvxltech.com">NVXL</a>, I lead the
      engineering team responsible for the entire software stack of the
      company's main product -- a Machine Learning acceleration platform, built
      upon a multi-FPGA hardware appliance. I oversee and work directly in the
      design, implementation and deployment of a wide range of components,
      among which: the OS device drivers; the low-level acceleration libraries;
      the python-based end-user APIs; the management user-interface; and the
      infrastructure which supports the automated testing and delivery
      pipelines.
      </p>
      <p>
      I am also directly involved in the product's development process, acting
      as project manager, proposing and introducing agile practises and methods,
      defining and prioritizing stories, and working closely with marketing,
      executives and other engineering teams.
      </p>
      <p>
      Prior to NVXL, I have worked as a software consultant and technical lead
      at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>, specializing in
      agile methodologies and lean software processes. I lead a team of 10
      engineers responsible for operating a micro-services oriented architecture
      for the company's main customer (the largest airline in Latin America) and
      was a member of its principal technical board.
      </p>
      <p>
      Education-wise, I hold a B.S. and M.S. degree in Computer Science from the
      <a href="http://www.dcc.ufmg.br">Federal University of Minas Gerais</a> in
      Brazil, and have worked as a research assistant at <a
      href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu">Rutgers University</a>, NJ. I am
      currently located in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil and may be reached
      at <span class="email"></span>.
